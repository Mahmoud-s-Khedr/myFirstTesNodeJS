# myFirstTesNodeJS
this is my very first time to interact with node js so i decided to make a micro todo app with very basic functionality.

to this app you will need:-
1. node js
2. mysql or mariadb (I used mariadb)
3. npm

api testing done using postman

used packages will be in package.json

you should run setup.sql in create the database the it's user.
